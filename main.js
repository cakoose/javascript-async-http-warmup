// 1. 'httpGet' is provided for you.
// 2. You have to implement 'httpGetParallel' and 'httpGetSerial'

// A non-blocking, callback-style function to make an HTTP GET request.
// When the request is complete, 'callback' will be called with
// the response body text.  For simplicity, we're ignoring errors.

// Example usage:
//     httpGet('https://example.org/', responseBody => {
//         console.log(`Got first page: ${JSON.stringify(responseBody)}`);
//
//         const targetUrl = extractFirstLink(responseBody);
